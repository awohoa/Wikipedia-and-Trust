## Abstract
In the new world of AI and technology, many wonder how reliable internet sources are. This includes one of the most popular sources of information, Wikipedia. Wikipedia remains relevant and trustworthy partly because it relies on humans who add content by posting and editing contributions on talk pages. However, AI may weaken this reliance on Wikipedia, as large language models can pull answers from Wikipedia and other sources so quickly that users have less need to engage and interact on Wikipedia pages. Our project explores how Wikipedia sustains its trust and relevance in the age of AI, and what its role may look like in the coming years.




## The Prototype Discription 
The prototype finds a random wikipedia article and returns its name, the amount of sources it has, and the amount of revivsions it had.
