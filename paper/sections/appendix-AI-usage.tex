% Document how you used AI tools in your research and writing process
% Be transparent and specific

\subsection{Literature Review}

[Describe how you used AI agents for literature review. Reference your .prompt.md file.]

Example: We used an AI agent workflow (see the file \href{}{literature-review.prompt.md}) to systematically process research papers. The agent extracted summaries, methodology descriptions, and key findings from papers in our bibliography.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

[If you used AI for data analysis, code generation, or statistical work, document it here]

\subsection{Writing Assistance}

[Document any AI assistance in writing: brainstorming, editing, restructuring, etc.]

Example: We used Claude/ChatGPT to help with [specific task, e.g., "improving clarity of the abstract" or "suggesting visualizations for our data"].

\subsection{Code Development}

[If AI helped you write code for data collection or analysis, document it]

\subsection{Verification}

[How did you verify AI-generated content? What human oversight did you apply?]

All AI-generated content was reviewed, verified against primary sources, and edited by the human author(s). Factual claims were cross-checked with original papers and data.
