Before what I thought a literature review was just summarizing what other people said. But when I had to design a workflow, I realized you have to be way more intentional about what information youâ€™re looking for and why. Breaking down the research into different tasks made literature review more organized and clear then just a simple summarization. 

Some of the challenges found with LaTeX was downloading the MiKTex and downloading all the tools. When compiling the template I got a lot of requests to download a bunch of packages for MiKTex and then I needed to update it even right after downloading it. I was familiar with LaTax before through Overleaf so inputting the essay was a fairly straight forward process.

Our next step is to run the data collection process using the Wikipedia API to retrieve a randomized set of articles and their associated metadata. Once the data is gathered, we will clean and organize it to remove duplicates or incomplete entries. We will then perform an analysis to explore potential relationships between revision frequency, contributor count, sentiment balance, and indicators of article trustworthiness such as citation count and article length.
After identifying patterns or correlations, we will interpret these results in the context of existing research on collaborative editing and information reliability. Finally, we will discuss the broader implications of our findings for how open-source platforms like Wikipedia can measure and improve trust in user-generated content.
